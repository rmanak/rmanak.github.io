        <h3>Hello! </h3>
              <p>
              I am currently a senior applied scientist in Amazon. Previous, I worked as a senior data scientist at Lyft focusing
              on applications of NLP and machine learning in community and road safety, support as well as applications of deep learning
              in spatio-temporal demand forecasting. Before Lyft, I was the co-founder and chief data scientist
              in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/aida-software-corp">Aida</a>, a machine learning startup, where
              I helped with research and development of AI solutions for natural language
              understanding in customer support/intelligent segment.
              Our company was
              <a href="https://betakit.com/vision-critical-acquires-aida-to-integrate-ai-applications-into-platform/">acquired by Vision Critical</a>
              in late 2017.

              Before working in industry, I was a PhD student in computational physics at University of British Columbia, 
	      where I worked on large scale distributed computing and numerical algorithms for
              gravitational physics research <a href="http://laplace.phas.ubc.ca/People/arman/">[+]</a>. My main interest these days is machine learning
              particularly focused on natural language understanding and more recently I am learning about meta-learning 
	      and how/why LLMs showcasing few-shot learning capabilities. I am finishing the AI graduate program at Stanford.
	      In my free time, I do <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rmanakb/">landscape photography</a>, DIY projects and traveling.
