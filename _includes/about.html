              Hello, I am Arman, data scientist, entrepreneur, photographer and python lover. I was the co-founder and chief data scientist
              in <a href="https://helloaida.io">Aida</a>, a machine learning startup, where I helped with research and development of AI solutions for natural language
              understanding in customer support/intelligent segment. Our company was <a href="https://betakit.com/vision-critical-acquires-aida-to-integrate-ai-applications-into-platform/">acquired by Vision Critical</a> in late 2017, and these
              days I work as principal data scientist at VC integrating ML capabilities to VC's customer intelligent platform.
              </p>

              <p>
              I hold a PhD degree in computational physics from UBC where I worked on large scale distributed computing and numerical algorithms for
              gravitational physics research <a href="http://laplace.phas.ubc.ca/People/arman/">[+]</a>. My main interest in machine learning
              is natural language "understanding" and its applications in semantic web. In my free time, I do landscape photography,
              resistance training, and traveling. I am also pretty addicted to Python and am trying to find my way to contribute to its
              amazing open-source community.

              Please feel free to <a href="http://www.akbarian.org/contact/">contact me</a>, if you think we have something to chat about!
              I love intellectual conversations, anything startup, bad puns and good beer!
